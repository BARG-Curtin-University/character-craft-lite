## ðŸ§  **Technical / Academic Pitch**

**CharacterCraft: Design the Soul Behind the Chatbot**  
CharacterCraft is a standalone tool for generating richly structured chatbot personalities, purpose-built for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and zero-shot prompting contexts.  

The tool integrates principles from organizational behavior, communication frameworks, and user experience design to support the systematic creation of AI character profiles. It allows researchers, educators, and developers to control key interaction dimensionsâ€”such as tone, emotional intelligence, negotiation style, and decision-making frameworksâ€”while maintaining compatibility with both commercial and open-source LLM providers.  

CharacterCraft can be used as:  
- A configuration front-end for role-based AI personas in educational simulations  
- A structured personality designer for chat-based or voice-enabled agents  
- A dataset generator for studying prompt engineering or human-AI interaction  
- A scaffolding tool for embedding socio-behavioral theory into conversational agents

**Use cases** range from **virtual mentors** and **organizational training bots** to **custom AI tutors** and **domain-specific assistants**.
