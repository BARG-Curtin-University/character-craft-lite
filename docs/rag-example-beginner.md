# 🧠 RAG Example: Beginner Demo (Python)

This guide demonstrates how to use markdown documents exported from CharacterCraft as a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base.

We provide a beginner-friendly Python example using [`llama-index`](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index).

## ⚡ Quick Start (Python)

> **Colab Users**: You can run this directly in your browser:  
> [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BARG-Curtin-University/charactercraft-lite/blob/main/docs/rag_demo.ipynb)

### ✅ Requirements
```bash
pip install llama-index openai
```

### 📂 Project Structure
```bash
rag-demo/
├── data/
│   ├── core-personality.md
│   ├── communication-guidelines.md
│   └── ...
├── rag_demo.py
```

### 🐍 Example: `rag_demo.py`
```python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI

# Load and parse markdown documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()

# Create a vector index
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Query with OpenAI
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(llm=OpenAI())
response = query_engine.query("What is this chatbot's communication style?")

print(response)
```

## 🗂️ Where to Place Your Files

All markdown documents generated by CharacterCraft (e.g. `Core Personality.md`, `Communication Guidelines.md`) should be placed in a `/data` folder.

Each document should:
- Be saved as `.md`
- Contain complete sections with consistent structure
- Avoid excessive overlap to improve relevance filtering

## 🧠 What is RAG?

RAG stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It’s a technique where:
1. User query → searches a vector database for relevant chunks
2. Chunks are injected into a prompt
3. Prompt is sent to a language model (e.g. GPT-4) for generation

This improves reliability, reduces hallucination, and ensures responses reflect your custom character.

## 📝 Tips
- Use small, focused documents (~200–500 words each)
- Avoid redundant content across documents
- Consider chunking long markdowns into smaller thematic files
- Always test with real queries before production deployment

This RAG workflow enables **zero-shot personality injection** using your custom-generated character documents from CharacterCraft.
