# 🧠 CharacterCraft RAG Demo

This folder contains **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** demos that use markdown documents exported from [CharacterCraft Lite](https://github.com/BARG-Curtin-University/charactercraft-lite) to inject personality into a language model.

We provide beginner-friendly examples in both **Python** and **JavaScript**.

## 🐍 Python Demo (Recommended)

The `rag_demo.py` and `rag_demo.ipynb` files demonstrate how to use [llama-index](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) with your markdown documents.
